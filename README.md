Robo Resume Assignment

   
Write a program that will allow a user to enter in:
- a name,
- an email address,
- an organisation

- start date (employment with the organisation)

- end date (employment with the organisation)

When the user is done entering the information, the program should output the information
to look something like the following:

John J Jingleheimer-Schmidt
jjjschmidt@gmail.com

Organisation

Randomness Incorporated

Start Date: 05 May 1928

End Date: 03 Aug 2017

If the user does not enter an end date, assume he/she is still employed (i.e. use the current date as the end date)

Calculate the period (in days) for which the user has been employed.

A user must enter his/her name, as well as start date.

Bonus points:

- Validate dates

- Make the application look pretty:

   - Add a 'home page'

   - Allow multiple users to enter details

  - Retrieve a list of entries from the database and display them
